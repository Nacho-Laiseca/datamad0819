# Analysis of Global Shark Attacks 

Sharks are believed to be dangerous predators but the number of shark attacks is much smaller than most people think.
This project will try to establish which countries have the highest number of attacks, which have the highest mortal rate and the reasons behind these attacks. This analysis is done in the hope it will be able to help us reduce even more the number of attacks and make the beaches of the world a safer place.

Hypothesis: I believe the analysis will determine that countries such as USA, Australia, New Zeland or countries in the caribbean area are where most attacks take place given the fact that these countries receive a lot of turism related to aquatic sports: surfing, snorkling, diving, fishing and bathing.  



Procedure analysis technique:

First, the data will be cleaned using pandas and python. This will include removing unnecessary columns and any data corrupt enought to be considered inconclusive, homogenize columns and add guessed values where needed.  

Once this data is clean, we wil use python to create a new dataframe with all the outliers. Pandas will be used to extract a csv file containing the clean data.

Finally, the analysis will be made using Tableua, a powerfull BI tool, this way it will be easier to present the result of the analysis in a visual and interactive way.
